                    <p class="solution"><b>The Solution:</b> I created a travel app called 'Triple.' You input information about the explorers, the location aspects you like and activities you like. I also created a brand for the app that works cohesively with the UI and the illustrations in the app. </p>

                    <p class="solution"><b>The Solution:</b> I used dots, lines and planes and two singular colours to convey 'Monsters Inc.' I also created an animated version to make it more fun and playful (like the movie.)

                <h3>Fashion Show Poster</h3>

                <p class="task"><b>The Task:</b> Kildress Wolfe Tones GAC needed a captivating poster for their fundraising Fashion Show. Their colours were to be within the poster, as should their crest and event details.
                    <p>
                        <p class="solution"><b>The Solution:</b> The club colours are not the most visually appealing - green, white and gold so I decided to work with a more limited palette of just gold and white. I used clipping masks in order to create this strong geometric representation. I think colour, shape and type all combine in the piece to create an aesthetically appealing piece.</p>

                <p class="solution"><b>The Solution:</b> I drew my Granda's old tractor as not only a representation of him but also my family history as a whole on both sides. To me, farming is a job and a lifestyle that requires hard-work and perservence. I see this tractor as a symbol of that.

                <p class="solution"><b>The Solution:</b> I used symbolic imagery to convey the narrative and feeling of Back to the Future. I used a gradient to create the lines of fire that are left by the DeLorean. I also used strong typography, in keeping with the modernist style.</p>
